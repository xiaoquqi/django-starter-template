# Log rotation configuration for Gunicorn logs
# This configuration ensures that Gunicorn logs are managed properly to avoid disk overuse.
# - Logs are rotated daily.
# - Up to 7 old log files are kept.
# - Old log files are compressed to save space.
# - No error is reported if the log file is missing.
# - Rotation is skipped if the log file is empty.
# - New log files are created with specified permissions (0644) and ownership (root:root).
# - Logs are rotated when their size exceeds 10MB.
