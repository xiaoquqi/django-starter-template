# Mito - Django Project Template Generator

Mito comes from the biological term "Mitosis" (cell division). Just as cells divide to create new life, Mito project template helps developers quickly create new Django applications. Each project created by Mito inherits carefully designed best practices while maintaining its own uniqueness.

> Like cell division, one perfect template can create countless excellent projects.

## Running in Production

The easiest way to get started is by using Docker Compose:

1. Clone the repository (you can rename the project to whatever you prefer, for instance, your_new_project):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xiaoquqi/django-starter-template.git your_new_project
   cd your_new_project
   ```

2. Copy the environment configuration file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

> NOTE: How to Set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
>
> - This setting defines the trusted domains for CSRF verification.
> - In a production environment, you must include the domain of your admin portal to ensure proper access.
>
> - Use a comma-separated list of trusted domains. For example:
>
>    ```bash
>    export CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://admin.example.com,https://api.example.com
>    ```

3. Start the services:

   **Scenario 1: Only API and Database Services**

   If your application only requires the API and database services without any asynchronous tasks or scheduled tasks, you can start the services as follows:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -f docker-compose.prod.yaml -d mito-api mito-mariadb
   ```

   **Scenario 2: Full Services with Asynchronous and Scheduled Tasks**

   If your application requires all services including asynchronous tasks and scheduled tasks, you can start the services as follows:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -f docker-compose.prod.yaml -d
   ```

4. Access the services:
   - Swagger API Documentation: http://localhost/swagger/
   - Admin Interface: http://localhost/admin/
       - Default username and password: admin/adminpassword
   - Flower(Celery Task Management): http://localhost:81/

## Developer Quick Guide

You can use this project as a foundation for developing new applications. I have created a simple starter app based on useful Django modules, and you are welcome to modify anything as you see fit. I will highlight the modifications to help you quickly set up a new project.

### Building the Development Environment

It is recommended to use an IDE with AI enhancements, such as VS Code with Copilot, Cursor, WindSurf, or any other tool you prefer. We are in the era of AI, so embrace it and become the master of AI.

1. Clone the repository (you can rename the project to anything you like, for example, your_new_project):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xiaoquqi/django-starter-template.git your_new_project
   cd your_new_project
   ```

   > NOTE: If you do not want to use the default project name `mito` and Django project name `api`, you can use the provided script in the project located at `tools/project_manager.sh` to replace them. Please refer to the documentation for more details on how to do this:[How to Change Project Name `Mito`?](#how-to-change-project-name-mito) and [How to Change Django Project Name `api`?](#how-to-change-django-project-name-api).

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Initialize the database and create a superuser:

   ```bash
   export DJANGO_DEBUG=True

   python manage.py migrate

   # Create a superuser
   python manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email admin@example.com
   # You will be prompted to enter a password
   ```

5. Start the Django Service:

When developing new APIs, you can skip starting Celery services and the database service, as Django defaults to using SQLite as its database.

   ```bash
   cd mito
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. (Optional) Start Celery Services:

To utilize Celery, ensure Redis is running before starting Celery. You can use the existing Docker Compose file to start Redis as follows:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up redis -d
   ```

Subsequently, you can start all Celery services.

   ```bash
   celery -A core worker --loglevel debug
   celery -A core beat --loglevel debug
   ```

7. Access the services:
   - Swagger API Documentation: http://localhost:18080/swagger/
   - Admin Interface: http://localhost:18080/admin/
       - Default username and password: admin/adminpassword
   - Flower(Celery Task Management): http://localhost:18081/

## Django Code Structure

All the Django code is located in the mito directory, which is generated by the django-admin startproject command. Therefore, all backend development is conducted within this directory.

### Django Project Structure

```

### Django Project Settings

This project is slightly different from a standard Django project. I have split the settings into several parts, allowing you to add or modify options based on your requirements.

#### How to add a new setting?

If you want to add configurations that may change depending on the environment, it is recommended to use environment variables. I have already set up automatic loading of the .env file located in the project's base directory. You can copy the .env.sample file to .env before starting development.

To add new environment variables in a Django project and configure them at startup, follow these steps:

1. Update the `.env.sample` File

First, define the new environment variable in the `.env.sample` file. For example, if you want to add a variable named `NEW_VARIABLE`, you can do it like this:

2. Load the new environment variable in base.py: Next, you need to load this new environment variable in the mito/core/settings/base.py file. You can use the os.getenv() function to retrieve the value of this variable.

``` python
# ... existing code ...

# New environment variable
NEW_VARIABLE = os.getenv("NEW_VARIABLE", "default_value")  # Set default value

# ... existing code ...
```

For settings or static variables unrelated to Django but related to the code, it is recommended to add them to the core/settings/constants.py file.

3. Use the new environment variable in the code: Now, you can use this new environment variable in other parts of the project. For example, you can use it in views, models, or other settings.

``` python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.conf import settings

def example_view(request):
    # Use your new environment here
    new_variable_value = settings.NEW_VARIABLE
    return JsonResponse({"new_variable": new_variable_value})
```

4. Ensure that the .env file is loaded at startup: Make sure to load the .env file when the project starts so that the new environment variables can be read correctly. You have already used load_dotenv(ENV_DIR) in base.py to load the environment variables, ensuring that the new variables are read at startup.

By following these steps, you can successfully add new environment variables and use them in your Django project.

## Authentication

### JWT

In this project, JWT (JSON Web Token) is used as the default authentication method. JWT allows you to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

#### How to use JWT?

1. **Normal Authentication**: To authenticate a user, send a POST request to the `/api/v1/auth/token/` endpoint with the user's credentials (username and password). If the credentials are valid, you will receive an access token and a refresh token.

   Example request:

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/auth/token/
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "username": "your_username",
       "password": "your_password"
   }
   ```

   Example response:

   ```json
   {
       "access": "your_access_token",
       "refresh": "your_refresh_token"
   }
   ```

2. **Refreshing the Token**: When the access token expires, you can obtain a new access token by sending a POST request to the `/api/v1/token/refresh/` endpoint with the refresh token.

   Example request:

   ```http
   POST /api/v1/token/refresh/
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
       "refresh": "your_refresh_token"
   }
   ```

   Example response:
   ```json
   {
       "access": "your_new_access_token"
   }
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively use JWT for authentication and token management in this project.

### About `accounts`

By default, all user authentication and authorization operations should be placed in the accounts directory. The accounts directory contains a standard Django application that implements a profile, establishing a one-to-one relationship with the default Django user module to extend user capabilities. Here is the structure of the accounts directory.

```
api
├── accounts
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   ├── 0001_initial.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── serializers.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
```

## API Documentation

### Swagger Configuration

This project includes a comprehensive Swagger configuration system that provides:

- **Standardized Response Format**: All API responses follow a consistent format with `code`, `message`, and `data` fields
- **Detailed Pagination Documentation**: Complete pagination structure with `total`, `page`, `pageSize`, `next`, and `previous` fields
- **Reusable Parameters**: Common parameters like pagination, ordering, and search are abstracted into reusable functions
- **Dynamic Schema Generation**: Uses dynamic class creation to avoid naming conflicts while maintaining detailed schema structure

**Usage Examples:**

```python
# Standard response
@extend_schema(responses={200: response(PostSerializer)})

# List response
@extend_schema(responses={200: list_response(TagSerializer)})

# Paginated response with parameters
@extend_schema(
    parameters=pagination_params() + [ordering_param()],
    responses={200: pagination_response(PostSerializer)}
)
```

**Available Functions:**

- `response(serializer)`: Creates standard response wrapper for single objects
- `list_response(serializer)`: Creates response wrapper for list endpoints
- `pagination_response(serializer)`: Creates detailed pagination response
- `pagination_params()`: Returns standard pagination parameters
- `ordering_param(default="created_at")`: Returns ordering parameter
- `search_param()`: Returns search parameter

### API Response Format

To make compatible with the frontend, the API response format is as follows:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "...": "..."
    },
    "code": 0
}
```

In frontend, the code is 0, which means success. If the code is not 0, it means an error occurred. You can make customization error code in the API response. A good best practice is to define different error codes for different types of errors.

So a middleware is added to the Django project to convert the response to the format above. The middleware is enabled by default, but you can disable `core.settings.middlewares.AxiosResponseMiddleware` by removing the middleware from the MIDDLEWARE list in the base.py file.

## Django Application

### API Versioning Strategy

The project uses URL-based versioning where version information is specified only at the routing level (e.g., `/api/v1/`). This approach follows Django best practices by keeping applications at the core level while maintaining clear version separation in the URL structure. This allows us to manage different versions of the API effectively, ensuring backward compatibility while enabling the introduction of new features and improvements in subsequent versions.

### Sample Application

In the `mito/sample` directory, you will find a complete example of a Django application that implements a blogging system.

This sample application contains a simple blog data structure, including posts, tags, and categories. Posts and tags have a many-to-many relationship, while posts and categories have a one-to-many relationship. You can also create a new post with new tags and categories, and the overridden create method will function in the serializers.py file. You can use this application as a sample and develop new applications according to your requirements.

You can test the interface on the Swagger page and find more details in the code.

### Create a new App

To create a new app in your Django project, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Django project.

2. Run the following command to create a new app (replace `your_new_app` with the desired app name):

   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp your_new_app
   ```

3. After the app is created, you will need to add it to your project's settings. Open `mito/core/settings/base.py` and add the new app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'your_new_app',
       ...
   ]
   ```

4. Now, you can start defining your models, views, and serializers in the newly created app directory (`your_new_app`).

5. Don't forget to create migrations for your models and apply them:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations your_new_app
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Finally, you can start developing your API endpoints in the `views.py` file of your new app.

By following these steps, you can effectively create and set up a new app in your Django project following best practices.

## Management Commands

### Custom Management Commands

This project includes custom Django management commands to help with development and testing. These commands are located in the `sample/management/commands/` directory.

#### show_time Command

The `show_time` command allows you to test Celery tasks without starting a Celery worker. This is particularly useful for development and debugging purposes.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Basic usage - show current time
python manage.py show_time

# Enable debug logging
python manage.py show_time --debug

# Enable verbose output (backward compatibility)
python manage.py show_time --verbose

# View help
python manage.py show_time --help
```

**Features:**

- **Structured Logging**: Uses Python's standard logging module with configurable levels
- **Debug Control**: `--debug` flag enables detailed logging output
- **Backward Compatibility**: `--verbose` flag maintains compatibility with older scripts
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with clear error messages
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses database transactions for data consistency

**Example Output:**

```
2025-07-20 02:56:43,737 - sample.management.commands.show_time - INFO - Info logging enabled
2025-07-20 02:56:43,737 - sample.management.commands.show_time - INFO - Starting show_current_time task
2025-07-20 02:56:43,738 - sample.management.commands.show_time - INFO - Running show_current_time task...
2025-07-20 02:56:43,748 sample.tasks INFO     Current time: 2025-07-20 02:56:43.748130
2025-07-20 02:56:43,748 - sample.management.commands.show_time - INFO - Show current time task completed successfully!
```

**Creating Custom Commands:**

To create your own management commands, follow this structure:

```
your_app/management/
├── __init__.py
└── commands/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── your_command.py
```

Example command structure:

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Description of your command'

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument('--debug', action='store_true', help='Enable debug logging')

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        logger.info('Starting your command...')
        # Your command logic here
        logger.info('Command completed successfully!')
```

## Project Customization

### How to Change Project Name `Mito`?

You can change the project name from `Mito` to a name of your choice if you prefer a different one. The only impact of changing the project name occurs after installation; the package name will be updated to your new name, and all related references will also be modified. For instance, the production Docker name will become NewName-api. If this is your intention, please follow the instructions provided.

``` bash
cd tools
./project_manager.sh --project-name myproject --dry-run
./project_manager.sh --project-name myproject
```

### How to Change Django Project Name `api`?

After installing this package, the project name will be `mito-xxx` and the package name will be `api`. You can freely change the package name since it only affects the installation path and has no impact on Django's runtime functionality. To rename the `api` package to a different name, please use the provided script.

``` bash
cd tools
./project_manager.sh --django-project-name myapi --dry-run
./project_manager.sh --django-project-name myapi
