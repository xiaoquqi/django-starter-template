"""
This module contains middleware classes that are user-defined for the Django
application. Middleware serves as a mechanism to process requests and responses
globally, either before they reach the view or after the view has completed
processing. Custom middleware can be implemented here to manage tasks such as
logging requests, authenticating users, or modifying responses. Each middleware
is typically a class that includes methods for handling requests and responses,
providing a flexible approach to manage various aspects of the request/response
lifecycle.
